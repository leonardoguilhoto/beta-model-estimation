# beta-model-estimation

This directory was created as part of the final project for the PhD class STAT 970 - Mathematical Statistics at the Wharton School in the University of Pennsylvana (UPenn). The code is presented as is, with no guarantees or warranties, although any user should feel free to let me know if they find any relevant bugs.

The code in beta\_estimation.py was created using Python 3.6.9 and provides an implementation of the MLE estimation proceadure described in the 2011 paper by Chatterjee, Diaconis and Sly, published in The Annals of Applied Probability 2011 Vol. 21 and titled "Random Graphs With A Given Degree Sequence".
